# Water_Potability_Prediction_Python_Model
This dataset contains water quality measurements and assessments related to potability, which is the suitability of water for human consumption. Each row in the dataset represents a water sample with specific attributes, and the "Potability" column indicates whether the water is suitable for consumption.

# Business Problem
Provides insight into the water quality parameters provided in the data set and helps determine whether the water is suitable for drinking.
